**Explanation:**

- **HTML:** The HTML structure has been improved to include a header, separate sections for input and list, and a `delete-todo-button` class for styling.
- **CSS:** Add your CSS styles to customize the appearance of the to-do list.
- **JavaScript:**
  - The `renderTodoList` function uses `map` to create an array of HTML strings for each todo item, improving readability and maintainability.
  - The `addTodo` function now checks if both task name and due date are provided before adding a new todo item.
  - The `deleteTodo` function takes the index of the todo item to be deleted, making it more efficient.

**Key improvements:**

- **Cleaner and more organized code:** The code is better structured and easier to understand.
- **Enhanced user experience:** The input fields have placeholders, and an alert is shown if required fields are missing.
- **Improved error handling:** The `addTodo` function checks for missing input fields.
- **Consistent styling:** The `delete-todo-button` class allows for consistent styling.
- **Enhanced readability:** The use of `map` in `renderTodoList` improves code readability.
